A simple post-installation script for setting up a fresh Linux Mint system.

This script automates essential tasks like:
- System update and upgrade
- Installing basic tools and applications (`curl`, `git`, `zsh`, `spotify`, `virtualbox`, etc.)
- Installing Flatpak packages (Discord, VS Code, etc.)
- Setting up **Oh-My-Zsh** with a minimal configuration
- Creating user directories (`Scripts`, `Misc`, `Notes`)
- Cloning a TryHackMe notes repository

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x post-linuxmint.sh

# Run it
sudo ./post-linuxmint.sh
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Customization

This script is tailored to my personal setup, but feel free to modify it according to your own preferences!

You can easily change:
- The list of system packages and Flatpak packages to install.
- The Oh-My-Zsh configuration (theme, plugins, aliases).
- Any other setup to fit your needs.
